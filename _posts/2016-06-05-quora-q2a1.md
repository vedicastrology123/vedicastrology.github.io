<td style="height:auto; vertical-align:top">

Rahu is in 9th house - Gemini (Mithuna).

Where is Budha situated?. In which nakshatra?.

Where is Shani the 9th house lord is situated?.

Without information for these above questions, only generic answers is possible by anybody. For a particular and accurate answer, with yoga and timing of an event, the birth details are needed.

A sample question with birth detail is as follows "What will be my career as per D1, D10 and nakshatra?. When will I get married as per my lagna and Navamsa and Nadi Amsa chart?.

I was born on February 4, 1996, at 11:30 AM, at Mumbai, India".

For horoscope predictions or any astrological questions like Dasamsa related, it is necessary to give birth details as above, for accurate analysis by any astrologer.

Refer above questionâ€™s answer. Further research into Nadi Palm leaf timing methodology is as below.

[Steve Hora\'s answer to What is the scientific basis of Nadi palm leaf astrology to predict accurately?](https://quora.com/What-is-the-scientific-basis-of-Nadi-palm-leaf-astrology-to-predict-accurately/answer/Steve-Hora)

1. It does NOT follow Vimshottari Dasha system.

2. It does NOT use Chandra as the base for timing.

3. It uses all divisional charts, for Mundane Predictions of event.

4. The timing of event is by Navamsa, D60 and D150.

5. The reading of a set of lines or stanzas is in multiples of 3 or 5, based on which Amsa chart is used for timing.

6. Mostly it is 3 years, so it is D60 being used. 7. Moving the house, for each set of years, gets the Mundane Predictions.

Answer by [Sheshachalam Iyengar](https://quora.com/profile/Sheshachalam-Iyengar) in his answer has explained it. Houses or signs and bhava or rashi chart in terms of divisional charts to be considered, to mathematically derive any.

Considering D10 as a chart by itself, begs explanation, for any graha placement, or lordship or power (neecha or oucha).

At least D9 has a proper definition in terms of nakshatra padas.

Going by above considerations, all other divisional charts have this definition as told, with its stated anomalies.

A closer look at D60 reveals secrets from a Nadi perspective. The same analogy can be used to derive mathematically, deduce and predict any divisional charts.

D150 becomes more difficult and becomes mysterious, and looks like one has to acquire and use divine powers, to predict.
