#### Panchang

Tithi information can be got from Hindu Calendar or Panchang.

Tithi helps to know the strength of Moon (Chandra) and Sun (Surya). Being an angular measure of Sun to Moon Tithi, it denotes the Space and Energy of Earthlings. This is because of the fact that All life depend on Solar and Lunar affectations, so Sun is called the Father and Moon the Mother of Earth and its Earthlings.

Tithi is important n Shri Chakra meditation, as the calculation for remedial works is entirely based on Tithis. This way the Space, Energy and Time of any Earthling can be synced, to dissolve and absolve the very Karma, good or bad.

So be it. Tathaastu.
