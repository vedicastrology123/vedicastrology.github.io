## Astrology Temple secrets

Refer below youtube for information about the Temple and its carvings which has
Astrological significance.

I am going to analyze the youtube data from vedic astrology point of view.

The temples which has astrological carvings are
* Pancha Varna Swami temple.
* Gangai Konda Shozhapuram
* KazhuKarsula Murthi temple

All temples are in Tamil Nadu, India.

The carving on the ceiling is in an inverted way. If a ceiling print is taken on a paper, then
the proper sequence will be seen.

Proceeding from the center, you will find the following

* 9 Nava graha's symbol at the center.
* 12 signs of zodiac around the navagrahas.
* 28 nakshatras squares with Abhijith nakshatra also shown.
* Then it is 20 Vimsamsas.
* 36 Drekanna squares around the vimsamsa square.

### Why Vimsamsa of 20 squares?

 Vimsamsa signifies religious and spiritual development and permanent wisdom.
