## What happened at Galwan on June 15th, 2020, night

- An astrological analysis by Steve Hora - Vedic Astrologer, Researcher and Subject Matter Expert (SME) on Vedic, Naadi and Mundane Astrology.

The event timing was taken from [India-today newspaper information]( https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/3-separate-brawls-outsider-chinese-troops-more-most-detailed-account-of-the-brutal-june-15-galwan-battle-1691185-2020-06-21)

The event started at 7 PM on June 15th 2020 and ended around 11 PM on the same night.

Below is the Mundane Vedic horoscope.

![Brave Soldiers of India](/assets/img/blog/brave-india-soldiers.png)

I use Vedic (Sidereal) horoscope for Accurate timing and analysis, according to Lahiri Ayanamsa (Chitra paksha), using sidereal solar years of 360, Analysis as per Parasara system and Timing using Vimshottari Dasha system and Samaya Amsa or Kaala or Naadi timing technique.

I proceed to read the mundane event horoscope as per Parasara system and Timing using Vimshottari Dasha system and Samaya Amsa or Kaala timing technique.

Lagna lord is Mars, the fierce war lord, and represented by Lord KarthiKeya, son of Lord Shiva, the Chief Commander of Devas (who all live in the Punya Bhumi, namely India).

Mars is in 4th house of Happiness, so a person whose name, indicates that, namely "Santosh" - Col. Santosh Babu, the Brave young Colonel leads the Indian patrol team to investigate around LAC line.

Lagna point and Mars is in Naarada drekkana, misunderstanding, not conducive events ensues and happens.

Mars (Kuja) is in the star of Purva Bhadra, ruled by arch enemy Saturn (Shani).

This marks the bad time for the Brave Soldier.

Shani is retrograde in 3rd, ruled by Saturn, and in 1/12 position with Mars.

3rd rules neighbors and small fights and 12th is loss.

"Brave Death in Line of Duty" happens at the hands of neighbor, who is an enemy (Saturn).

Sun (Surya) as yogakaraka is 10th lord sitting in 8th, indicates that (In Duty death) with great honor.

Kuja (Mars) is in trine with Surya, so becomes famous after death.

The 8th lord Budha is in 8th, makes him famous after his death, event, and also his unit, army and country.

His colleagues represented again by Shani is the dispositor of Mars-sitting house, namely Kumbha.

Many of his colleges die with him in line of duty, as he had.

Shani is sitting in Surya nakshatra, which confirms that death happens in line of duty, in fighting the neighbor (3rd house).

6th house, which is fight, misunderstandings and theft, is also governed by Mars. So the event is also based on the same.

8th lord Budha in 8th, is with Rahu, has made the event, create suspiciousness of the enemy and their intent, and bad karma happens.

Luckily Surya as 10th lord and yogakaraka is with Budha, so the problems arising out of this event, gets solved politically by Sun, at the highest power levels.

Chandra, who is both yogakaraka and badaka sitting in 5th, does make the event painful and famous as well.

Mars denotes number 9, Budha as 5 and Shukra as 6, Ketu - 7, Guru - 3, Shani - 8, Surya - 1, Chandra is 2, and Rahu as 4.

In Navamsa, comparatively between these fighting Grahas, the bindus ratio is 20 is to 50 on enemy side, accordingly the losses of life.

Luckily Budha is in Agaastya drekkana, so all ends well.

### About Steve Hora, Vedic Astrologer

I am a born astrologer, as per Sri Vaithiswara Agasthiya Koushiha Nadi Grantha in Tamil.
In my palm-leaf reading, one of my profession is mentioned as below

“ஜோதிடமும் கலை சார் அணி பண்டம் ….”

It means Astrology, Graphical Yantras are some of my professions.

I use Vedic (Sidereal) horoscope for Accurate timing and analysis, according to Lahiri Ayanamsa (Chitra paksha), using sidereal solar years of 360, Analysis as per Parasara system and Timing using Vimshottari Dasha system and Samaya Amsa or Kaala or Naadi timing technique.

Astrologically, I love to analyze Vedic (Sidereal) or Western (Tropical) Astrology, comprehend it and solve the unresolved question of human existence, in its various aspects, events, tribulation and the very ending.

(This quality of mine is due to 5th lord Shukra sitting in 4th, and looking at 10th, Ketu is with Shani in Makara lagna. Shukra being my Yogakaraka graha, sitting in Aswini Ketu-nakshatra, in my horoscope).

I challenge the status quo, ad-literam and anecdotal of vedic and western astrology, navigate uncharted waters, to find newer vistas from the astrology lore and find the truth. Be unbiased, even with my own opinion, or by the very information gathered, than to assimilate, digest, critically analyze, synthesize and find the truest path, which had been lost to time.

(This quality of mine is due to Chandra exalted in Vrishabha and Makara Lagna Shani and Ketu sitting in Abhijit nakshatra).
