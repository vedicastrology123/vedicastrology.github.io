### Astrology - Western and Vedic differences

Vedic and Western astrology have some similarities, including the 12 signs of the zodiac, but Vedic astrology emphasizes the rising sign at the precise moment of birth rather than the 30-day sun sign. Also, the difference between the sun signs in the two systems of astrology is said to be 24 degrees, meaning that one might identify with a different constellation.

In Vedic astrology, a master astrologer, known as a Jyotish Acharaya, uses a variety of charts to further refine the individual's horoscope.
