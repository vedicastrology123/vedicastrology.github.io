## Enrich and Optimize your life with Vedic Astrology ( Jyotish )

Karma plays an important role in one's destiny or fate. Free Will has its part also. Read more below ...

Vedic Astrology captures this Karma of Yours in your Horoscope.

### What is Vedic Astrology - An Introduction

Vedic Astrology is one of the Vedas, the ancient Hindu scriptures. In Vedic astrology, a person's destiny is determined by his/her karma, which is set forth in the cosmic design.

Vedic and Western astrology have some similarities, including the 12 signs of the zodiac, but Vedic astrology emphasizes the rising sign at the precise moment of birth rather than the 30-day sun sign.

In Vedic astrology, a master astrologer, known as a Jyotish, uses a variety of charts to further detailed reading an individual's horoscope.

Vedic (Sidereal) horoscope is made according to Precession ( True Lahiri Ayanamsa - Chitra paksha), using sidereal solar years of 360.
Birth chart analysis is as per Parasara system and Timing using Vimshottari Dasha system and Samaya Amsa or Kaala or Naadi timing technique.

#### What is in it for me

** With your accurate Date of Birth, Place and Time - a horoscope is made using pure astronomical data of planets.

A horoscope has 12 houses or parts which govern different aspects of your life. You can read about that at [12 Houses of Vedic Astrology](/blog/vedic-astrology-meaning/).

Each house significance can be enriched by knowing its strength, weakness, life events for that house and its good and bad time.

With free will of yours, you can Enjoy the good strength in good time.

With same free will, you Do good karma, for prevention or protection from bad karma of that house in bad time.

There are remedies which is based on "What you sow is what you reap", which is the Karma way for Universal judgment.

The karmic effect is between births. It is true that we are reborn to Enjoy or Suffer of our past birth karmic deeds.

The horoscope is the photo-capture of our previous birth's karma.

We can modify, suffer, enjoy, deny, postpone, BUT we cannot escape karmic effect. We can carry forward it to the next birth.

#### How to go about

**Life is just Space, Energy and Time, like this Universe**

I read your horoscope for

  * Strength and Weakness

  * When the life events will happen and how your perspective is, as of now and thereafter.

  * Give advice to correct your bad karma at a spiritual, psychological, mental and physical level.

  * The above corrections take care of anomalies at Space and Energy level only.

  * Time Karma correction is done by syncing your Space, Energy and Time as per your horoscope and using techniques which ensures that your time is any time as good time, and you sail this Ocean of Life smoothly.

#### Can one change Destiny with Free Will

Yes, if you have no karmic balance from previous birth, nor in this birth.

Then your Free Will comes into action, to create newer Good Karma or Bad as well.

Or one can absolve all these Karmas, like Lord Buddha did, and attain Enlightenment.
