Below is the procedure that should be followed for Nadi reading.

#### Thumb Impression
Your thumb impression is a prerequisite. For male it is right and female it is left.
The thumb impression is to select the category of the palm-leaf bundle. One can ask the Nadi Reader about this to know more.
I call him/her as a Nadi Reader because He/She is NOT an Astrologer, just a translator from Old Tamil to New Tamil.
The type of thumb imprint is also read to you. There are 18 categories of thumb imprint and within which more sub-categories. The thumb imprints helps in locating the set of bundles of palm-leaf.
Locates Your Palm leaf.
The nadi reader from his catalog and with your thumb imprint category, will bring many Nadi bundles.

He will open one bundle which will contain many palm-leaf.
He would read few lines and decipher in colloquial Tamil, and ask you a question.
The answer should be No or Yes, never divulge any other details.
Example : If the nadi reader reads from palm-leaf that 'Your father name is so-and-so or starts with the letter "Sha".' If your father name starts in Sha, just answer "Yes", do not divulge your father name.
If you say "No" to a question, the Nadi reader will flip out that palm leaf and go for the next.
This flipping, he will do even if one of your answer was "Yes" but "No" for another question.
This procedure will go on till he exhausts all palm-leaf in that bundle and start with a new one.
When all questions are answered as "Yes", he had selected the right palm-leaf. Still not over...
#### Reading from Your Palm leaf
From your palm leaf he would recite your birth horoscope with the following details

Graha position and Lagna as in Lagna or Rashi chart
Tamil Year, month, date, week day of your birth
Your nakshatra and Moon sign (rashi in tamil)

If this is as per your computer-modern generated horoscope, you have your fate and destiny on this tiny palm-leaf starring at you.
It is still a mystery about how without any birth details, a palm leaf has your chart, written long long ago.
