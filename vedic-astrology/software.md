[**Jagannatha Hora is the best Free Vedic Astrology software**](https://www.vedicastrologer.org/jh/).

**Recommended by Steve Hora, Vedic Astrologer**, Researcher and Subject Matter Expert (SME) on Vedic, Naadi and Mundane Astrology.

I use it for my research and accurate predictions. Reach me at 'vedicastrology123 at gmail dot com' and [Vedic Astrology - Jyotish](https://stevehora.com) .

I am a born astrologer, as per Sri Vaithiswara Agasthiya Koushiha Nadi Grantha in Tamil.
In my palm-leaf reading, one of my profession is mentioned as below

“ஜோதிடமும் கலை சார் அணி பண்டம் ….”

It means Astrology, Graphical Yantras are some of my professions.

I use Vedic (Sidereal) horoscope for Accurate timing and analysis, according to Lahiri Ayanamsa (Chitra paksha), using sidereal solar years of 360, Analysis as per Parasara system and Timing using Vimshottari Dasha system and Samaya Amsa or Kaala or Naadi timing technique.

Astrologically, I love to analyse Vedic (Sidereal) or Western (Tropical) Astrology, comprehend it and solve the unresolved question of human existence, in its various aspects, events, tribulation and the very ending.

(This quality of mine is due to 5th lord Shukra sitting in 4th, and looking at 10th, Ketu is with Shani in Makara lagna. Shukra being my Yogakaraka graha, sitting in Aswini Ketu-nakshatra, in my horoscope).

I challenge the status quo, ad-literam and anecdotal of vedic and western astrology, navigate uncharted waters, to find newer vistas from the astrology lore and find the truth. Be unbiased, even with my own opinion, or by the very information gathered, than to assimilate, digest, critically analyse, synthesize and find the truest path, which had been lost to time.

(This quality of mine is due to Chandra exalted in Vrishabha and Makara Lagna Shani and Ketu sitting in Abhijit nakshatra).
